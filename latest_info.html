    <h3>Recent announcements</h3>
    <p><strong>ATTENTION: The account history of every merchant and mentor will be under observation. So RED ALERT for all the mentors: you are requested to stop making illegal merchants. If any suspicious activity is found, your account will be suspended and you will lose mentorship. This is applicable from 14/03/2019 22:00:00 PM.</strong></p>
    <h3>New updates</h3>
    <p>We are bringing significant changes in mentor/merchantship. Some changes are not yet finalized but we will give you some ideas so that you can be prepared. From April 15, 2019, all merchants/mentors renewal will be turned off for next 1 month (30 days). From May 15, 2019, the following changes will be applicable:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>There will be no automated merchantship renewal system. The process will be manual. Both mentor and wanna-be-merchant user will have to register for new merchantship (mentor will register for the wanna-be-merchant as his/her sub and wanna-be-merchant user will register for his/her merchantship renewal under his/her desired mentor). After the process and account history being verified by our authority, the wanna-be-merchant will be promoted to merchant.</li>
        <li>There will be some qualification requirements for a user to register as a mentor. We will update about those as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>The mentorship and merchantship rate will change. Mentorship will require at least 1 million BDT credit purchase and merchantship will require at least 200K BDT credit purchase from a mentor.</li>
        <li>A mentor can make up to 20 merchants and tag 30 normal users. A merchant can tag 20 users. But this will be monitored and may be changed if needed.</li>
    </ul>
	<p><strong>NB:</strong>Note that all the above changes are not yet finalized. The authority has full right to change these anytime they want. It is our suggestion to you to read all the above rules carefully and understand them.</p>

    <h3>Things to remember</h3>
    <p>The private chat feature is still under some observations. There are some limitations in private chat. For
        example: if you knock any user, that user <strong>may not be</strong> notified of your text. For this, you have
        to <strong>Buzz</strong> the user. You can see the Buzz option in menu in private chat.
        We do not store your private chat messages. We delete them every day at 10:00 PM BD time (GMT + 6). So
        it will be better not to send your precious texts in private from time 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM. </p>
    <p>One thing we should also mention that if the user who you want to chat with, does not have proper internet
        connection or has failed to update notification token to our server, <strong>WILL NOT</strong> receive your
        Buzz.</p>
